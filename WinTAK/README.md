# ICU VideoStreamer — WinTAK Plugin

Part of the TAK-PluginSuite-ICU_VideoStreamer suite. A WinTAK plugin for live video streaming with automatic CoT video announcement, GPS-linked position, and OpenTAK Server integration.

## Features

- **FFmpeg-based streaming** — RTMP, RTMPS, RTSP, RTSPS, SRT, UDP
- **Floating status widget** — a persistent plugin-icon HUD (mirrors the ATAK build) that shows a red/green dot and a pulsing **LIVE** label while streaming. Click it to open the pane; drag to relocate (position is remembered). Created at plugin load, so it's visible whether or not the pane is open.
- **Clickable stream URL** — the credential-free stream URL is overlaid on the bottom-left of the preview; click it to copy to the clipboard
- **WinTAK GPS integration** — position updates automatically from WinTAK's location service; no separate GPS setup
- **CoT video + sensor announcement** — sends a `b-i-v` video event and re-broadcasts the sensor (FOV cone) CoT every 10 s through WinTAK's existing TAK server connection, using your WinTAK callsign and UID
- **Screen share mode** — capture your desktop instead of a camera
- **Optional recording** — save a local copy while streaming
- **OpenTAK Server** — register/unregister the stream via REST API

## Requirements

- WinTAK 5.6.x (SDK 5.6.0.151)
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) — set path in Settings → Stream

## Installation

### Dev build (auto-deploys on build)

1. Copy WinTAK DLLs from `D:\Apps\` into `libs\` (see list in `VideoStreamPlugin.csproj`)
2. Open `VideoStreamPlugin.sln` in Visual Studio 2022
3. Build (Debug) — the DLL is copied to `D:\Apps\Plugins\` automatically
4. Restart WinTAK — **Video Stream** appears in Home → VISTA Tools

### Release (.wpk)

Build Release configuration, then install the generated `.wpk` via WinTAK's Plugin Manager.

## Settings

| Tab | What to configure |
|-----|------------------|
| **Stream** | Protocol, URL, stream key, credentials, FFmpeg path |
| **Video** | Codec, resolution, frame rate, bitrate, recording |
| **Audio** | Device, codec, bitrate |
| **OpenTAK** | Server URL, bearer token |

Callsign, team, role, and TAK server connection are read directly from WinTAK — no separate configuration needed.

## Architecture

```
VideoStreamModule.cs       MEF entry point — also creates the floating status widget at load
VideoStreamButton.cs       Home ribbon button (VISTA Tools group)
VideoStreamDockPane.cs     ViewModel — imports ILocationService + ICotMessageSender
VideoStreamView.xaml       Dock pane UI
StreamStatusWidget.xaml    Floating plugin-icon HUD (owned overlay window); click=open, drag=move
StreamStatusHub.cs         One shared streaming flag the pane writes and the widget reads
SettingsWindow.xaml        4-tab settings dialog
Services/
  StreamingService.cs      FFmpeg subprocess management
  OpenTAKServerClient.cs   REST API client
Cot/
  CotBuilder.cs            Builds b-i-v video CoT XML
```
